# VMinion Breakout PCB

This project is focused on creating a PCB that simplifies connections on the Ratrig VMinion. Although designed be me, it is inspired by the divider PCB mod by Vector3D [here](https://github.com/AdamV3D/RR-V-Minion-Mods/tree/main/V3D%20Divider%20PCB). 

## :warning: Beta Version :warning:
Please note that the "VMinion Breakout PCB" is currently in a **beta phase**. It's constantly being updated and improved. Use this mod at your own risk. Parts (printed cases) will come soon.

## Open Source
Everything related to this project is open-source. Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are always welcome.

## Bill of Materials (BOM)
A work-in-progress BOM is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l2unTY74QwLAbzYWbJA4JIBaFDDriVfRlH6mz4mGnKs/edit?usp=sharing).
